Yesterday I learned about GitHub pull requests on Udacity’s course How to Use Git and GitHub.

A pull request is not the same as a pull. A pull is when you download commits from GitHub to your local
repository. A pull request is when you make a request to another GitHub user to merge a commit/commits you’ve
pushed onto GitHub, into their repository. I think pull request is poorly worded; merge request would be more
suitable.

After you add, commit, and push your commit/s to GitHub, you can make a pull request. The creator of the master
repository will receive a message. Through the pull request, they can see the changes you’ve made and give you
comments, or merge the pull request into their repository.

It’s recommended that your pull request is from a separate branch instead of the master, so that it’s easy to
edit or scrap without changing the master branch.

Here’s some reflections I wrote that is part of the coursework:

Question: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Answer: You could send the files to each other via e-mail, or keep all of your versions uploaded on a cloud
service such as Dropbox. If the user wasn’t always making add, commit, push, and pull requests, then they may
save some time. Collaborating might be more difficult because you would have tell your partner where you made
changes, and you would to check if there are any conflicts, which Github does for you.
