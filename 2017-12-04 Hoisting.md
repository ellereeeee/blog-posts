Here are my notes on "Hoisting," Kyle Simpson's [fourth chapter](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch4.md) of _You Don't Know Javascript: Scope and Closures_.

We can see "hoisting" in the example below:

```
a = 2;

var = a;

console.log(a);
```

People unfamiliar with Javascript's lexical scoping might expect `undefined` from this block of code, since it seems `var = a` redefines `a`. However, we get `2`.

This is because all variable and function declarations are made during the compilation phase, while assignments are made during the execution phase.

Javascript actually interprets the code like this:

```
var = a;

a = 2;

console.log(a) // 2
``` 

The term "hoisting" comes from the idea that we are bringing these variables to the top of the code.

Execution logic is left in place, even function expressions. For example, in `var foo = function bar() { // do something.. }`, `foo` is hoisted but the `bar` function is not. It is assigned during the execution phase.

Functions are hoisted first.

Hoisting happens per-scope.

Duplicate definitions of the same identifier in the same scope can be really confusing, especially between normal var and function declarations. Try not do it.

You can why this is a bad idea here:

```
foo(); // "b"

var a = true;
if (a) {
   function foo() { console.log( "a" ); }
}
else {
   function foo() { console.log( "b" ); }
}
```

Both `foo()` declarations are hoisted above the `foo()` call. The second `foo()` declaration rewrites the first and thus `b` is printed to the console.
