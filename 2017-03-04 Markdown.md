It was recommended to me that I start writing my blog posts/notes in Markdown, so today I learned how to write in Markdown from [www.markdowntutorial.com](www.markdowntutorial.com).

Taken from that site,

> Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It’s written in what nerds like to call “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( \` ).

It's a very popular way of writing content and you can find a multitude of articles discussing why you should write in Markdown with a [simple Google search](https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=markdown&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab&gfe_rd=cr&ei=8yG6WKziBseE9AXNmYeoDg#q=why+you+should+write+in+Markdown&*).

Markdown is great because it strikes a great balance between the focus on formatting text and creating content. Markdown gives you the ability to style your text more than a plain .txt file, but reduces the overhead from heavy text formatting in Microsoft Word.

It's also plain text, so it can opened across multiple applications, editors, and devices.

You can find a full list of syntax at [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

I’ll be writing my blog posts in Markdown from now on, converting the .md files into Medium posts with this [tool](http://markdowntomedium.com/).
