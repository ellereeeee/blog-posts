These are my notes on "Mixing (Up) "Class" Objects," Kyle Simpson's [fourth chapter](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch4.md) of _You Don't Know Javascript: this and Object Prototypes_.

### Class Theory

OO or class oriented programming stresses that data intrinsically has associated behavior that operates on it, so  proper design is to package up the data and the behavior together. This is sometimes called "data structures" in computer science.

For example, a series of characters is usually called a "string." The characters are the data. You usually want to do operations on the string like checking its length, appending data, etc. A `String` class would include these as methods as well as the string data.

Classes imply a way of _classifying_ a certain data structure. We do this by thinking of any given structure as a specific variation of a more general base definition.
