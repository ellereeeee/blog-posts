Today I worked on the third lesson in Udacity’s course on How to Use Git and Github for about three hours.
Here are some reflections I wrote, which was part of the coursework.

Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
1) Backing up your project files
2) Uploading your project for feedback from others
3) Collaborating on a project with others/making your project open source

Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
The user may later decide they don’t want the changes made on GitHub,
so there would be no reason to pull changes yet.

Question:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer:
branch — a history of commits with the most recent one being at the end or “tip” of the branch.
Branches are created when the user wants to work on something while not affecting.
the production code.

clone — copying a repository.
Cloning is used when a user wants to copy a remote or local repository into another local repository.

fork — copying a remote from another user into a new remote repository of the user.
Used when you want the code from another user, while still crediting their work.

Here are some Git commands I learned:

git remote // no arguments, shows all current remotes
git remote add [name used to refer to repo on GitHub ex: origin] [GitHub remote url]
git remote -v // v stands for "verbose." shows existing remotes
git push [remote to push change to] [branch to push]
// ex. git push origin master
git pull [remote to pull from] [branch to pull]
// ex. git pull origin master
