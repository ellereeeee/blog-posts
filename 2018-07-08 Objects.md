These are my notes on "Objects," Kyle Simpson's [third chapter](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch3.md) of _You Don't Know Javascript: this and Object Prototypes_.

### Syntax

Objects come in two forms. The declarative (literal) form:

```javascript
var myObj = {
    key: value
    // ..
};
```

And the constructed form:

```javascript
var myObj = newObject();
myObj.key = value;
```

You should pretty much always use the literal syntax form.

### Types

Objects are the general building block upon which much of JS is built. It is one of the 6 primary types in JS, which are:

* `string`
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `null`
* `undefined`
* `object`

Everything in JavaScript is *not* an object!

There are few special object sub-types, which are also called _complex primitives_.

A `function` is a sub-type of object (technically a "callable object"). Arrays are also a form of objects with extra behavior.

#### Built-in Objects

There are several other object sub-types usually referred to as built-in objects. These are:

* `String`
* `Number`
* `Boolean`
* `Object`
* `Function`
* `Array`
* `Date`
* `RegExp`
* `Error`

These are simply built-in functions. They can be used as a constructor (a function call with the `new` operator) with the result being a newly constructed object of the sub-type in question.

For example:

```javascript
var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof strPrimitive;  // "string"
strPrimitive instanceof String;  // false

var strObject = new String( "I am a string" );
typeof strObject; // "object
strObject instanceof String; // true

// inspect the object sub-type
Object.prototype.toString.call( strObject ); // [object String]
```

You can see that `strObject` is an object created by the `String` constructor.

`"I am a string` is not an object, it's a primitive literal. To perform operations on it, such as checking its length, a `String` object is required. JavaScript coerces a `"string"` primitive to a `String` object when necessary.

Only use the constructed form if you need to create extra options not available in the literal form.

### Contents

Contents of an object consist of values stored at specifically named locations called properties. The values themselves are not actually stored inside the object. Property names (references) are stored, which point to where the values are stored.

`.` syntax is known as property access or dot notation and `[]` syntax is referred to as key access or bracket notation. For example:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

myObject.a; // 2

myObject["a"]; //2
```

The `.` syntax required an `Identifier` compatible property name while `[]` sntax can take any UTF-8/unicode comptabile string as the name for the property. For example, to refernce the property "Super-Fun!" you would have to use `["Super-Fun!"]` syntax to access the value.

`[]` syntax also uses a string's **value** to specify the location. You can access property values with variable. For example:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

var idx = "a";

console.log( myObject[idx] ); // 2
```

Property names are **always** strings. Be careful not to confuse the use of numbers between objects and arrays.
