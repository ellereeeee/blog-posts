These are my notes on "Objects," Kyle Simpson's [third chapter](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch3.md) of _You Don't Know Javascript: this and Object Prototypes_.

### Syntax

Objects come in two forms. The declarative (literal) form:

```javascript
var myObj = {
    key: value
    // ..
};
```

And the constructed form:

```javascript
var myObj = newObject();
myObj.key = value;
```

You should pretty much always use the literal syntax form.

### Types

Objects are the general building block upon which much of JS is built. It is one of the 6 primary types in JS, which are:

* `string`
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `null`
* `undefined`
* `object`

Everything in JavaScript is *not* an object!

There are few special object sub-types, which are also called _complex primitives_.

A `function` is a sub-type of object (technically a "callable object"). Arrays are also a form of objects with extra behavior.

#### Built-in Objects

There are several other object sub-types usually referred to as built-in objects. These are:

* `String`
* `Number`
* `Boolean`
* `Object`
* `Function`
* `Array`
* `Date`
* `RegExp`
* `Error`

These are simply built-in functions. They can be used as a constructor (a function call with the `new` operator) with the result being a newly constructed object of the sub-type in question.

For example:

```javascript
var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof strPrimitive;  // "string"
strPrimitive instanceof String;  // false

var strObject = new String( "I am a string" );
typeof strObject; // "object
strObject instanceof String; // true

// inspect the object sub-type
Object.prototype.toString.call( strObject ); // [object String]
```

You can see that `strObject` is an object created by the `String` constructor.

`"I am a string"` is not an object, it's a primitive literal. To perform operations on it, such as checking its length, a `String` object is required. JavaScript coerces a `"string"` primitive to a `String` object when necessary.

Only use the constructed form if you need to create extra options not available in the literal form.

### Contents

Contents of an object consist of values stored at specifically named locations called properties. **The values themselves are not actually stored inside the object. Property names (references) are stored in objects, which point to where the values are stored.**

`.` syntax is known as property access or dot notation and `[]` syntax is referred to as key access or bracket notation. For example:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

myObject.a; // 2

myObject["a"]; //2
```

The `.` syntax requires an `Identifier` compatible property name while `[]` syntax can take any UTF-8/unicode comptabile string as the name for the property. For example, to refernce the property "Super-Fun!" you would have to use `["Super-Fun!"]` syntax to access the value.

`[]` syntax also uses a string's **value** to specify the location. You can access property values with a variable. For example:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

var idx = "a";

console.log( myObject[idx] ); // 2
```

Property names are **always** strings.

#### Computed Property Names

ES6 adds _computed property names_ that let you write an expressions in the key-name position of an object-literal declaration. For example:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  [prefix + "bar"]: "hello",
  [prefix + "baz"]: "world"
};

myObject["foobar"]; // hello
myObject["foobaz"]; // world
```

One handy real-world use of computed property names is for [reducing handlers for multiple inputs in React](https://medium.com/@zacjones/handle-multiple-inputs-in-react-with-es6-computed-property-name-e3d41861ae46). They are also commonly used for primitive type ES6 `Symbol`. `Symbol`s have an opaque unguessable value (technically a `string` value).

#### Property vs. Method

It's not uncommon to hear "method access" as opposed to "property access." Do not let this mislead you into believing functions "belong" to objects. The implicit binding of `this` to objects shows that a function's relationship to an object is indirect at best. Every time you access a property on an object, that is a **property access**. 

Function `someFoo` and `myObject.someFoo` would just be two separate references to the same function.

#### Arrays

Arrays are objects. Even though each index is a positive integer, you can also add properties onto the array. For example:

```javascript
var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];

myArray.baz = "baz";

myArray.length; // 3

myArray.baz; // "baz"
```

Notice that adding named properties does not change the reported `length` of the array.

#### Duplicating Objects

Trying to duplicate an object in JavaScript is complicated. Should one make a _shallow_ or _deep_ copy of an object?

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2,
  b: anotherObject, // assume this is a reference to another object
  c: anotherArray, // and this to another array
  d: anotherFunction 
} 
```

In a _shallow copy_ the value `2` would be copied but `b`, `c`, and `d` would just be references to the same places as the original object. A _deep copy_ would duplicate not only `myObject` but also `anotherObject` and `anotherArray`. If we were to write `anotherArray.push( anotherObject, myObject)`, then `anotherArray` would have references to `anotherObject` and `myObject`. Those would also have to be duplicated, and thus we have an infinite circular duplication problem.

A shallow copy is fairly understandable and has far less issues. ES6 has introduced `Object.assign(..)` for this task. `Object.assign()` takes a _target_ object as its first parameter and one or more _source_ objects as its subsequent parameters. It iterates over all the _enumerable_, _owned keys_ (**immediately present**) on the _source_ objects and copies them (via `=` assignment only) to _target. For example:

```javascript
var newObj = Object.assign( {}, myObject );

newObj.a; // 2
newObj.b === anotherObject; // true
newObj.c === anotherArray; // true
newObj.d === anotherFunction; // true
```

#### Property Descriptors

As of ES5 all properties are described in terms of a **property descriptor**. You can see them in the example below:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( myObject, "a" );
//{
//  configurable: true,
//  enumerable: true,
//  value: 2,
//  writable: true
//}
```

The ability for you to change the value of a property is controlled by `writable`. Trying to change a property with `writable: false` will silently fail or return a `TypeError` in `strict mode`.

This is not to be confused with `configurable`. `configurable` determines whether or not you can change descriptor definitions with `defineProperty(..)`. For example:

```javascript
Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
  value: 4,
  writable: true,
  configurable: false, // not configurable!
  enumerable: true
} );
```

Changing `configurable` to `true` from `false` will result in a `TypeError` regardless of `strict mode`. Changing `configurable` to `false` is a one-way action and cannot be undone.

`configurable: false` also prevents the ability to use the `delete` operator to remove an existing property.

`enumerable` controls if a property will show up in a certain object-property enumerations, such as the `for..in` loop.

#### Immutability

Sometimes we want to make properties or objects immutable (cannot be changed). Let's look at some approaches that create shallow immutability.

On a side note, it is not terribly common to create deeply entranched immutable objects in JS programs. If you do this you should reconsider your program design to be more flexible to changes in objects' values.

You can essentially create a _constant_ (cannot be changed, redefined, or deleted) by combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false`.

```javascript
var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "FAVORITE_NUMBER", {
  value: 42,
  writable: false,
  configurable: false
} );
```

You can prevent an object from having new properties added to it but leave the rest of the object's properties alone with `Object.preventExtensions(..)`.

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

Object.preventExtensions( myObject );

myObject.b = 3;
myObject.b; // undefined
```

`Object.seal(..)` creates a "sealed" object that calls `Object.preventExtensions(..)` on it and makes all existing properties non-configurable. Note you can still modify existing property values.

`Object.freeze(..)` creates a frozen object. It calls `Object.seal(..)` on it but also marks all existing properties as `writable: false`. This is the highest level of immutability that you can attain for an object.

### `[[Get]]`

Property accesses are performed with a default built-in `[[Get]]` operation  (like a function call on the object). The `[[Get]]` operation first inspects the object for a property of the requested name, and if it finds it, it will return the value. If it cannot find the value, it returns the value `undefined`.

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

myObject.b; // undefined
```

This is different from when you reference _variables_ by their identifier names. When the value for a variable cannot be found in the applicable lexical scope look-up, `ReferenceError` is thrown.

### `[[Put]]`

`[[Put]]` is the internally defined operation for assigning a property on an object. `[[Put]]` behaves differently based on a number of factors.

For example, if a property is present, `[[Put]]` will check:

1. Is the property is an accessor descriptor (aka a getter or setter)? If so, call the setter.

2. Is the property a data descriptor with `writable: false`? If so, silently fail in `non-strict mode` or throw `TypeError` in `strict mode`.

3. Otherwise, set the value to the existing property as normal.

If the property is not present the `[[Put]]` operation is even more complex. We will discuss this in Chapter 5 when discussing `[[Prototype]]`.

#### Getters & Setters

`[[Put]]` and `[[Get]]` are the default internal operations for dealing with object properties.

ES5 lets you override part of these operations on a per-property letter through getters and setters. **Getters are properties which call a hidden function to retrieve a value. Setters are properties which call a hidden function to set a value.**

Getters and setters are "accessor descriptors" (as opposed to "data descriptors"). The `value` and `writable` characterstics are moot and the `set`, `get`, and `configurable` and `enumerable` characteristics are considered for accessor descriptors. 

This is a getter declared with object-literal syntax:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  get a() {
    return this._a_;
  },
};
```

A property is created that doesn't hold a value, but whose access automatically results in a hidden function  call to the getter function. You can aso define getters explicitly with `defineProperty(..)`.

You almost always want to declare both a getter and a setter. Reassignment to `Object.a` would silently fail in the example above. The example below properly includes a setter.

```javascript
var myObject = {
  get a() {
    return this._a_;
  },
  set a(val) {
    this._a_ = val;
  }
};
```

Note that we store the value into another variable `_a_`. This is just another property name; `_` does not denote special syntax.

#### Existence

We can check an object for a property without trying to check the property's value.

```javascript
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

("a" in myObject); // true

mybject.hasOwnProperty( "a" ); // true
```

The `in` operator will check if a property name is in the object or higher up the `[[Prototype]]` chain. `hasOwnProperty` will do the same but will not  check the `[[Protoype]]` chain.

`propertyIsEnumerable(..)` will test is a property name exists on the object and is also `enumerable: true`. `Object.keys(..)` will return an array of all enumerable properties and `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(..)` will return an array of _all_ properties, enumerable or not. The latter two functions do not check the `[[Prototype]]` chain.

### Iteration

You can iterate an array's indices with a standard `for` loop. `forEach(..)` will iterate over all values in the array and ingore any callback return values. `every(..)` keeps going until the end or the callback return a `false` value. `some(..)` does the same, except it stops if it returns a `true` value.

You can iterate an object with a `for..in` loop, but it only iterates over the properties. It is up to you to get the values manually.

You can interate over array values directly with `for..of`. You must make your own custom `@@iterator` property to use `for..of` on objects. This consists defining a `Symbol.iterator` property and using a `next()` method to advance through data values one at a time.
